# Meal Randomizer

This was made for my application to BCNY. It displays my willingness to learn Swift while making something creative to merge the concepts from the PE Fellowship involving creativity, membership and design.
A mobile application designed to help users decide what to eat by spinning a wheel of meal options. Perfect for picky eaters and group decisions!
This is a practice project taken from Coursera's Advanced Programming in Swift. This does not actually run _yet_ but it helped me have something to get my certificate!

## Installation

1. Install `Xcode` for iOS Development.
2. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone 'https://github.com/nanonite9/MealRandomizerApp.git'
    ```
3. Open the project in Xcode and run it on a simulator or your device.
